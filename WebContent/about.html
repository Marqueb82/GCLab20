			<p><font color="white">Java was the first programming language I learned.  From

			Kotlin, Python and Android programming.</font></p>

			<p><font color="white">Eventually I want to dive deeper into mobile application
			development in connection with mobile commerce. M commerce is an emerging part
			of consumer behavior and I believe mobile commerce will only expand and become
			the main connection between sellers and consumers.</font></p>
